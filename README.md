  Reason For The Challenge.
</h4>

> At Makers, we learn processes and best practices when writing code and not languages. From week one to week four we have been learning best practices on how to test drive codes using Ruby and Rspec. This week we have been thrown into the unknown and we(cohort) have to test drive Airport challenge which we did in Ruby in week one. The aim of the challenge is not to complete the airport challenge, but to prove to ourselves that we can test drive and programming language.
